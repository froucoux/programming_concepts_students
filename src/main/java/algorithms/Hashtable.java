/**
 * Question:
 *
 * Below you can find the Hashmap implementation from the syllabus; however,
 * this implementation only allows adding and getting elements.
 * You must implement the delete function that allows removing elements from the map.
 *
 * Once it is done, copy-paste the complete class, with the imports, in Inginious.
 *
 *
 * A Hash table generalizes arrays by allowing indexes with other types than integers;
 * for example, Strings as in this class.
 * To do so, a integer value is computed from the String, called a hash, and then put
 * back in the ranges of the array with a modulo.
 * This does not ensure that different elements go into different cells; hence each cell hash
 * a linked list to store the elements.
 * Hence, the methods in the maps are expected to be in O(1) for a good hash function.
 *
 * Your method delete must be in O(1) amortized complexity and O(n) in the worst case,
 * with n the number of elements in the map.
 *
 * Feel free to add methods or fields in the class but do not modify
 * the signature and behavior of existing code
 *
